## Description
E-WheelChAIr is an open-source project designed to enhance autonomy and accessibility for electric wheelchairs. It integrates:
- A **ROS2-based architecture** for real-time control and sensor fusion.
- **3D-printed mechanical parts** (sensor mounts, joystick adapters).
- **Modular design** for easy customization and collaboration with partners like the University of Milan.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- Electric wheelchair with Sabertooth 2x60A motor driver (or equivalent).
- Sensors: Intel Realsense (depth camera), HC-SR04 (ultrasonic), Arduino (I/O interface).
- Joystick or alternative control input device.

### Software
- ROS2 Humble (or Foxy).
- colcon (build tool for ROS2).
- FreeCAD 0.20+ (for 3D modeling).
- Git LFS (for versioning large 3D files).

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RenaudFookIng/E-WheelChAIr.git
cd E-WheelChAIr
```

### 2. Build the ROS Workspace
```bash
cd EWheelChAIr_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

### 3. Launch the System
```bash
ros2 launch e_wheelchair_bringup system.launch.py
```
*(Replace `e_wheelchair_bringup` with your actual launch package name.)*
